# Savant-Scape
Code using baseballr package to scrape all pitch-by-pitch data from 2015-2020 regular season

All years are set to save as specific csv files. There is customization at the bottom for what columns I wanted to pull from the scrape. Final line of code is saving all data in one csv file that can be loaded into your own database or however you please. This scrape takes a long time if you do it all at once
